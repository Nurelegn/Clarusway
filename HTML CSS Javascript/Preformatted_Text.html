      Its possible to include many lines in a paragraph as such, however the
      browser will ignore the lines and display each line as a single line. The
      solution to solve this problem, if you need to display the paragraph as
      it's written, you need to wrap it in a "pre" tag, which tells the browser
      that it's preformatted text.
    </p>

    <pre>
                If you include some lines and 
                spaces               in your html paragraph 
                the unnecessary indentation will                 be ignored by the browser and 
                it will be displayed as a single line as well, unless you specify it as 
                preformatted. 
                </pre

    <p>
      Also the lines displayed will depend on the size of the browser window. If
      you resize the browser window, the number of lines in this paragraph will
      change.
